##### Possible TODOs:

*Apart from the few mentioned in the code*

- Performance testing (Have to present data)
- Constructors
  - ~~`(vector of initial values of same type, function pointer or lambda)`~~
  - ~~`(initial value, function pointer or lambda)`~~
  - ~~Possible choice of iterative or recursive~~
  - From begin and end iterators
  - For iterative, specifying identity
- ~~`build` function~~
- ~~`query` function~~
- ~~`update` function~~
- ~~method to change function pointer or lambda~~
- ~~`print` method for testing~~
